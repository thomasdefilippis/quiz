#Overview

In this application, the user selects the answer to multiple questions in a quiz format. When the user answers a question, the program grabs the next question and options and displays where the previous data was rendered. Finally, after the user has answered each question, the quiz app calculates their average score, displays it, and shows the correct answers to each question.
